# project-plan-
We decided to work on restaurant robot, so we have done the project sheet together by making our first meeting on Wednesday at 7:30 
then our fantastic engineers wrote the distribution of task for each course and determine the time line
and we make sure to being in the safe side as we can
and that's what we get!
